# Save each command to the history file as it's executed.
# This does mean sessions get interleaved when reading later on, but this
# way the history is always up to date.  History is not synced across live
# sessions though; that is what `history -n` does.
# Disabled by default due to concerns related to system recovery when $HOME
# is under duress, or lives somewhere flaky (like NFS).  Constantly syncing
# the history will halt the shell prompt until it's finished.
